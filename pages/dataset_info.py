    **Important Limitations:**
    
    1. **Temporal Bias**: The dataset contains articles from 2015-2017, so the model may be less accurate on very recent topics
    2. **Source Bias**: Real news comes primarily from Reuters, which may introduce a specific writing style bias
    3. **Topic Coverage**: Some current topics (e.g., COVID-19) are not represented in the training data
    4. **Cultural Context**: The model is primarily trained on Western media and may not perform as well on news from other cultural contexts
    5. **Satire Detection**: The model may misclassify satire as fake news

    **Responsible Use Guidelines:**
    
    - This tool should be used as anè¾…åŠ© tool, not as the sole arbiter of truth
